# Star Zoom Feature Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented the ability to click and zoom into stars in system view, displaying them with hyper-realistic procedural textures based on stellar physics.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Star Click Detection
- Added clickable userData to star objects in StarRenderer
- Updated canvas interaction to detect clicks on central stars
- Added cursor hover effects for stars in system view

### 2. Star View Mode
- New "star" view mode added alongside galaxy, system, and planet modes
- Transition functions for smooth camera movement to star close-up view
- Automatic zoom-out detection to return to system view

### 3. Stellar Information Display
- Comprehensive star info panel showing:
  - Spectral classification (O, B, A, F, G, K, M)
  - Physical properties (temperature, radius, mass, luminosity, age)
  - Comparison to our Sun (temperature %, radius %, mass %)
  - Planetary system information (number of stars, confirmed planets)
- Real-time classification based on spectral type

### 4. Realistic Star Rendering
- Hyper-realistic procedural textures with:
  - Spectral-type-specific surface features
  - Sunspots, granulation, and convection cells
  - Chromosphere and corona layers
  - Stellar prominences and flares
- Animated surface with rotation and pulsation
- Different features for each stellar class:
  - O/B stars: Smooth blue giants with minimal features
  - A/F stars: White/yellow-white with moderate granulation
  - G stars: Sun-like with sunspots and faculae
  - K stars: Orange stars with many active regions
  - M stars: Red dwarfs with extensive spotting and flares

### 5. Navigation and UI
- Seamless transition from system view to star view
- Optimized return to system view (shows planets without re-rendering)
- Settings visibility updated for star view mode
- Cursor changes to pointer when hovering over stars

## Technical Implementation

### Modified Files
1. `frontend/src/lib/rendering/stars/StarRenderer.js` - Added clickable userData
2. `frontend/src/hooks/useCanvasInteraction.js` - Star click detection and cursor updates
3. `frontend/src/hooks/useViewTransitions.js` - Star view mode and transitions
4. `frontend/src/lib/managers/ui/InfoTabManager.js` - Star information display
5. `frontend/src/components/ExoplanetViewer.jsx` - Integration and state management
6. `frontend/src/lib/managers/settings/SettingsManager.js` - Settings visibility for star view

### Key Design Decisions
- Stars use existing StarRenderer with full detail (no simplified mode)
- Planet/orbit hiding when viewing star for cleaner visualization
- Efficient navigation back to system view without full re-render
- Stellar data extracted from planet objects (stars share properties)
- Animation loop handles star-specific updates (rotation, pulsation)

## Usage
1. Navigate to any star system in the explorer
2. Click on the central star
3. Camera smoothly zooms in to show star surface details
4. View stellar properties in the Info panel
5. Zoom out or use zoom threshold to return to system view

## Commits
1. Make stars clickable by adding userData properties
2. Add star click detection and cursor hover in system view
3. Add star view mode and transition functions
4. Add star information display with full stellar properties
5. Wire up star selection and animation in main component
6. Add star view mode to settings visibility handler
7. Optimize star to system view transition

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Stars are clickable in system view
- [x] Cursor changes to pointer when hovering over stars
- [x] Camera smoothly transitions to star close-up
- [x] Star info panel displays all stellar properties
- [x] Star surface animations work (rotation, pulsation)
- [x] Zoom out returns to system view
- [x] Settings visibility updates correctly
- [x] No linting errors
